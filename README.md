1. Revising Python
- revised python through a short crash course by mosh hamedani, made notes in notebook

2. Learning Numpy and Pandas
- practiced and learnt more about numpy and pandas libraries in python, both of which are very essential for ML
- numpy = https://github.com/KeithGalli/NumPy, pandas = https://github.com/KeithGalli/pandas (notes were already there, i just imported them in jupyter on my pc)

3. Starting with Neural networks (mostly theorotical)
- Learnt about backpropogation, weights, biases, linear regression, gradient descent, loss function
- predicting a squiggle/graph to fit the observed values through a neural network
- learnt about neural networks with multiple inputs and outputs, argmax, softmax, cross entropy etc
- learnt advanced neural networks through RNNs, LSTMs, Word2Vec
- learnt about encoders, decoders, transformer neural networks and ultimately the basic decoder type transformer neural networks of LLMs like chatgpt

4. Starting with Pytorch
- just started with it, about 20% done

This was all about 5 weeks of work, our project is about 6-8 weeks long, i am a little behind but i will definitely catch up
